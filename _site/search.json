    "text": "All of our work for this course will be done in the R language and we will be working with R in RStudio. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) develop by a company named Posit. Please be sure to download and install the most recent versions of R and R Studio from Posit’s website.\nIt is a good idea to periodically update R and RStudio. RStudio will prompt you when it is time to update and you can follow the same process of downloading and installing from the Posit website that we just did here. For R, there are a number of ways to do it, but the easiest is to use packages like installr for Windows and updateR for Mac. Here is a good blog post that walks you through the steps of how to update R using these packages. I usually update R once a semester.\nWe are going to be using a number of R packages throughout the course. One essential set of packages are those that comprise the Tidyverse, but especially readr, dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyr. You can install the entire Tidyverse collection of packages by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in your console. We will talk about these packages in detail as we go through the course, but have a look at this basic description now to gain some basic familiarity.\nAnother thing that you really want to do is to make sure that you have the native pipe operator (|&gt;) enabled. In RStudio, go to Tools&gt;Global Options, then go to Code and select “Use native pipe operator.”\nWhile you are here, you can also go to Appearance to select a different editor theme or to Pane Layout to change how the four panes in R Studio are organized. Next, familiarize yourself with how to expand and minimize the four windows. The most important window that I want to highlight here is the source window. This is where we are going to be working most of the time in this course. And if I tell you to send your source code, I mean to send the file that you are working on in this window. This could be a Quarto document, an R script or an app.R file for a Shiny app.\nThe next window is the Console and there we also see tabs for Terminal and Background Jobs. The console is where you can run R code one line at a time. The terminal is relevant for more advanced users and we will make some use of it when we talk about publishing Quarto documents. Background Jobs is going to be helpful when we want troubleshoot a Quarto document that is not rendering properly.\nFrom there, the next pane we want to explore is Environment, History, etc. Environment tells us what files are currently available to us. The other important tab here is Git which will be where we push things to GitHub. You will be using this a lot in the course.\nFinally, we see a pane with Files, Plots, Packages etc. Files tells us what files are in our project folder and enables us to copy, and delete files associated with our project. Plots is a window for viewing our visualizations. And Packages shows us what packages are available and loaded into our environment.\nBefore you move on to the next section, take some time to familiarize yourself with the various user-friendly buttons and shortcuts available to you like the drop down menu for the pane layout, a spell checker, a button for inserting a code chunk and other features that you can play around with.",

Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax.

    "text": "Overview\nThis week we are going to be talking about making tables in R. Tables can be a great way to summarize data for your audience. While there are no hard and fast rules about when to use a table versus a plot, typically we use tables when we want to present summary statistics that we want to compare across groups or when we want to show the precise values for individual data points. This can be true when we have a small number of cases that we want to discuss.\nIn this module we are going to be working with the tidycensus package to download income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the kableExtra and gt packages to visualize it. Along the way, we discuss “the grammar of tables” and some situations where a table would be less appropriate than other methods of visualizing our data."

    "text": "Working with tidycensus\n\nWe are going to start by using tidycensus to download some income data. To use tidycensus you need a Census API key, which you can get here.\n\nlibrary(tidycensus)\ncensus_api_key(\"YOUR API KEY\") # enter your census api key here in quotes\n\nUse the load_variables() function to import data from the census or ACS for a particular year. There is a cache = TRUE option if you want to cache the data for faster retrieval in the future. We can save our data in an object called v21 and then click on it or use View() and the search function in the data frame viewer to see what data are available.\n\nv21 &lt;- load_variables(2021, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\n#View(v21)\n\nWe want data on income quintiles, so let’s search for “quintile” in the search field. From there we use get_acs() to retrieve the data based on the codes for the five quintiles and the top five percent of earners.\nIn our call, we specify “state” as the geography and “2021” as the year. This will ensure that data from the 2017-2021 ACS is retrieved. Note that by default, tidycensus returns data such that rows represent a unit-variable combination. To get the data with census variables in the columns, we have to specify wide form with output = \"wide\". We will select all of the variables except for the margin of error and GEOID. Let’s rename NAME so it is in lower case. And for some reason, tidycensus puts an “E” suffix at the end of all of our variables when we specify wide format, so let’s use rename_with() and str_remove from the [stringr] package to get rid of that suffix. We will save the data frame in an object called quintiles.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nquintiles &lt;- get_acs(geography = \"state\", \n                      variables = c(q1 = \"B19081_001\",\n                                    q2 = \"B19081_002\",\n                                    q3 = \"B19081_003\",\n                                    q4 = \"B19081_004\",\n                                    q5 = \"B19081_005\",\n                                    top5 = \"B19081_006\"),\n                      year = 2021,\n                      output = \"wide\") |&gt;\n                      select(\n                        !ends_with(\"M\"), # eliminate margin of error\n                        -GEOID) |&gt; # eliminate geo id\n                      rename(name = NAME) |&gt;\n                      rename_with(~str_remove(., 'E'))\n    \n\nglimpse(quintiles)\n\nRows: 52\nColumns: 7\n$ name &lt;chr&gt; \"Alabama\", \"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\", \"California\", \"Colora…\n$ q1   &lt;dbl&gt; 11602, 19344, 15486, 12076, 17433, 18963, 17417, 17052, 12971, 14…\n$ q2   &lt;dbl&gt; 31928, 51030, 40774, 31051, 49234, 49711, 48870, 44638, 51060, 37…\n$ q3   &lt;dbl&gt; 55270, 81169, 66384, 52280, 84658, 80679, 84042, 73187, 94478, 62…\n$ q4   &lt;dbl&gt; 88640, 122652, 102299, 82811, 134560, 123359, 133488, 111915, 157…\n$ q5   &lt;dbl&gt; 193311, 242097, 223521, 188510, 309857, 264516, 319533, 238612, 3…\n$ top5 &lt;dbl&gt; 336788, 394694, 395620, 344470, 555007, 466181, 602707, 420859, 6…"

The table header includes the title and possibly a subtitle. Next, we have the stub section that contains our row labels and, above that, a stubhead label, which we could use to provide more information about what is in the rows. Then, we have column labels that tell us about what is in each column and the table body which contains the actual data that we want to present. Finally, we have the table footer, which would contain any notes that we have about information contained in the table as well as information about sources. Check out the gt function reference to get a sense of all the customizations available.\nLet’s go ahead and start out by making a basic gt table with a title, subtitle, column labels, source note and format the numbers as dollar figures.\nMake a good gt table\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngoodtable &lt;- gt(states) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Mean Household Income of Quintiles, 2021\",\n    subtitle = \"Seven Representative U.S. States\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    name = \"\",\n    q1 = \"lowest\",\n    q2 = \"second\",\n    q3 = \"third\",\n    q4 = \"fourth\",\n    q5 = \"highest\",\n    top5 = \"top 5%\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  fmt_currency(\n    columns = c(q1:top5),\n    currency = \"USD\", \n    use_subunits = FALSE\n  ) |&gt;\n  # note that you can use markdown (md) to format the source note for html documents\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"**Source**: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey\"))\n\ngoodtable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Household Income of Quintiles, 2021\n\n\nSeven Representative U.S. States\n\n\n\nlowest\nsecond\nthird\nfourth\nhighest\ntop 5%\n\n\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n$12,971\n$51,060\n$94,478\n$157,803\n$375,792\n$670,768\n\n\nNew York\n$14,054\n$42,220\n$75,647\n$123,318\n$302,676\n$574,063\n\n\nNevada\n$15,024\n$40,468\n$66,247\n$101,591\n$224,480\n$410,161\n\n\nKansas\n$15,817\n$40,065\n$64,780\n$99,380\n$215,122\n$383,038\n\n\nIowa\n$16,044\n$40,632\n$65,701\n$98,967\n$203,398\n$352,704\n\n\nMississippi\n$10,096\n$27,963\n$49,418\n$80,125\n$175,581\n$308,523\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n$2,906\n$12,144\n$22,163\n$38,397\n$99,043\n$187,234\n\n\n\n\nSource: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey\n\n\n\n\n\nChange column width\nNow let’s add some further customization.

Let’s do an example with median income estimates. We can start by searching for “median income” and discover that the code for median income is B06011_001.

The “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics.” The grammar of graphics is a layered approach to constructing graphs based on a book by Leland Wilkinson.\nThe idea is that each visualization you make is going to contain cerain elements. You will start with some data. Then you will incorporate some “aesthetics” which you can think of as the dimensions of the visualization (x-axis, y-axis and color, size or shapes for additional dimensions). Next you identify a geometric obejct that you want to use such as a bar, a line or a point. From there you can customize various elements of the plot like the title and axis scales and labels.",

Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading in the dem_summary.csv file that you can find here. Next we will do our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = \"Democracy by region, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks pretty good but frequently we would want the bars of our bar chart to be sorted in order of the values being displayed. Let’s go ahead and add the fct_reorder() from the forcats package to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nlibrary(forcats)\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = fct_reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

We will specify system = 'gw' to denote the Gleditsch-Ward country coding system. Then we will filter for roughly the same years of Fearon and Laitin’s original analysis (1945-99) with the caveat that peacesciencer only has conflict data starting in 1946.\nThen we add a bunch of data to the data frame using the various add_X functions available in the package. Here we add UCDP conflict data which includes our dependent variable for this analysis–conflict onset. Then we add measures of democracy, ethno-religious fractionalization, GDP and terrain.\n\nlibrary(peacesciencer)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nconflict_df &lt;- create_stateyears(system = 'gw') |&gt;\n  filter(year %in% c(1946:1999)) |&gt;\n  add_ucdp_acd(type=c(\"intrastate\"), only_wars = FALSE) |&gt;\n  add_democracy() |&gt;\n  add_creg_fractionalization() |&gt;\n  add_sdp_gdp() |&gt;\n  add_rugged_terrain()\n\nglimpse(conflict_df)\n\nRows: 7,624\nColumns: 22\n$ gwcode         &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2…\n$ gw_name        &lt;chr&gt; \"United States of America\", \"United States of America\",…\n$ microstate     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ year           &lt;dbl&gt; 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1…\n$ ucdpongoing    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ ucdponset      &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ maxintensity   &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ conflict_ids   &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ euds           &lt;dbl&gt; 1.293985, 1.308359, 1.343539, 1.330836, 1.354015, 1.350…\n$ aeuds          &lt;dbl&gt; 0.4862558, 0.5006298, 0.5358093, 0.5231064, 0.5462858, …\n$ polity2        &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9…\n$ v2x_polyarchy  &lt;dbl&gt; 0.603, 0.607, 0.599, 0.580, 0.585, 0.611, 0.611, 0.612,…\n$ ethfrac        &lt;dbl&gt; 0.2226323, 0.2248701, 0.2271561, 0.2294918, 0.2318781, …\n$ ethpol         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.4152487, 0.4186156, 0.4220368, 0.4255134, 0.4290458, …\n$ relfrac        &lt;dbl&gt; 0.4980802, 0.5009111, 0.5037278, 0.5065309, 0.5093204, …\n$ relpol         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.7769888, 0.7770017, 0.7770303, 0.7770729, 0.7771274, …\n$ wbgdp2011est   &lt;dbl&gt; 28.539, 28.519, 28.545, 28.534, 28.572, 28.635, 28.669,…\n$ wbpopest       &lt;dbl&gt; 18.744, 18.756, 18.781, 18.804, 18.821, 18.832, 18.848,…\n$ sdpest         &lt;dbl&gt; 28.478, 28.456, 28.483, 28.469, 28.510, 28.576, 28.611,…\n$ wbgdppc2011est &lt;dbl&gt; 9.794, 9.762, 9.764, 9.730, 9.752, 9.803, 9.821, 9.857,…\n$ rugged         &lt;dbl&gt; 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073, 1.073,…\n$ newlmtnest     &lt;dbl&gt; 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214868, 3.214…\n\n\nNow let’s go ahead and run the analysis. We will specify a logit model using the glm() function and specifying family = binomial(link = \"logit\"). We will store our model in an object called conflict_model. And from there we can use the tidy() function from the broom package to view the results.\nBefore doing this, though, try calling summary() from base R on the model. This provides us with a basic regression table and it is great insofar as we don’t want to do anything else with these estimates. Next, go ahead and call View() on the model object of just click on it to see what it looks like. You will notice that the results are stored in a complicated list format.\nThe tidy() function enables us to take the results from this list and store them in a “tibble”, which is the Tidyverse equivalent of a data frame. Once the results are stored like this, we can easily access the estimates for anything that we might want to do with them including combining the results of different models or displaying particular estimates in our document using all of the tools that we have learned in this course. We can also set conf.int = TRUE) as an argument in tidy() to create and store confidence intervals.\nBy default, tidy() returns p-values with large numbers of digits following the decimal point, making hard to tell whether the variables are significant. To fix this, we can pipe our tidy() output into a mutate_if() call and specify that we want numeric output to round to five decimal places.\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\nconflict_model &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ ethfrac + relfrac + v2x_polyarchy + \n                        rugged + wbgdppc2011est + wbpopest,\n                  data= conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\n# summary(conflict_model)\n\ntidy_model &lt;- conflict_model |&gt;\n  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 5)\n\ntidy_model\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 7\n  term           estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)     -5.38      1.41      -3.81  0.00014 -8.13       -2.60 \n2 ethfrac          0.709     0.372      1.91  0.0566  -0.00829     1.45 \n3 relfrac         -0.288     0.409     -0.702 0.482   -1.10        0.511\n4 v2x_polyarchy   -0.652     0.513     -1.27  0.204   -1.67        0.344\n5 rugged           0.0836    0.0756     1.11  0.269   -0.0716      0.226\n6 wbgdppc2011est  -0.392     0.120     -3.26  0.0011  -0.632      -0.161\n7 wbpopest         0.285     0.0677     4.20  0.00003  0.153       0.418\n\n\nHow did we do relative to Fearon and Latin’s original analysis. Well, one thing that F&L were pretty certain about is that ethnic and religious fractionalization do not matter for conflict onset. But here we find a statistically significant relationship between these variables and conflict onset. But one thing we do find in common with their analysis is the importance of wealth and population. Both of these variables are significant in the expected direction. Wealthier countries experience less risk of conflict onset while more populous ones have a higher risk."

    "text": "Run many regressions and display with modelsummary\n\nbroom is really great if we want to just run one regression and see the results in the context of a working document. But what if we want to display our results to other researchers? For this, we need to use a different package. One package that is really good at producing professional-looking tabels is modelsummary and one of its strongest features is the ability to combine multiple models into the same table while still allowing for substantial customization.\nLet’s go ahead and store four models. In the first three, we will feature sets of predictors (ethnicity, democracy and terrain) and then a final model that includes all of our predictors. In each model, we will include wealth (GDP) and population as controls because we have a feeling that these are robust predictors of conflict onset.\n\nethnicity &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ ethfrac + relfrac + wbgdppc2011est + wbpopest, # store each model in an object\n                  data = conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\ndemocracy &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ v2x_polyarchy + wbgdppc2011est +  wbpopest,\n                  data = conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\nterrain &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ rugged + wbgdppc2011est + wbpopest ,\n                  data = conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\nfull_model &lt;- glm(ucdponset ~ ethfrac + relfrac + v2x_polyarchy + rugged +\n                        wbgdppc2011est + wbpopest,\n                  data = conflict_df,\n                  family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\nNext we will store our models as a list with intuitive names that we can display as column headers in our regression table. Then we will store a new coefficient mapping where we rename our variables and change the order that they will appear in the table. We will also store a title and a reference.\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\"Ethnicity\" = ethnicity,  # store list of models in an object\n               \"Democracy\" = democracy, \n               \"Terrain\" = terrain, \n               \"Full Model\" = full_model)\n\ncoef_map &lt;- c(\"ethfrac\" = \"Ethnic Frac\",  # map coefficients\n        \"relfrac\" = \"Religions Frac\",     #(change names and order)\n        \"v2x_polyarchy\" = \"Polyarchy\",\n        \"rugged\" = \"Terrain\",\n        \"wbgdppc2011est\" = \"Per capita GDP\",\n        \"wbpopest\" = \"Population\",\n        \"(Intercept)\" = \"Intercept\")\n\ncaption = \"Table 1: Predictors of Conflict Onset\" # store caption\nreference = \"See appendix for data sources.\"      # store reference notes\n\nNow we can call modelsummary(). The first argument is the list of models we want to display. Next we tell modelsummary that we want it to show stars for statistical significance (stars = TRUE). And in gof_map, we say that, of the many goodness of fit statistics available to us, we only want to include the number of observations.

A better option could be to display a coefficient plot that shows point estimates and confidence intervals. This is often preferable with one model because it makes our results so much easier to interpret.\nLet’s try making a coefficient plot with modelplot() from the modelsummary package. The syntax for modelplot() is very similar to that of modelsummary() but there are a few small differences.\nFirst, it puts maps the coefficients from the bottom up, so if you to maintain the order of the coefficients you need to reverse the mapping. We do this with the rev() function.\nSecond, we want to omit the intercept with coef_omit = \"Intercept\" because the emphasis in a coefficient plot is less on the exact regression equation and more on the magnitude and significance of the coefficients.\nThird we can customize various things. We can specify the color of the points and confidence intervals and we can load ggplot2 for further customization. Now we can add geoms and labels just like any other ggplot object. Here we add a red vertical intercept line at zero to make it clearer which variables are significant (e.g. the confidence interval does not overlap with zero). And we add a title and a caption using the labs() function.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nmodelplot(conflict_model, \n          coef_map = rev(coef_map), # rev() reverses list order\n          coef_omit = \"Intercept\", \n          color = \"blue\") + # use plus to add customizations like any ggplot object\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = .75) + # red 0 line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Figure 1: Predictors of Conflict Onset\",\n    caption = \"See appendix for data sources.\"\n  )"

    "text": "Here are some datasets that you might consider using for your final project:\n\nfredr is an R package that provides access to the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. FRED is a comprehensive database of economic data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The package allows you to search for and download data from FRED directly into R.\nGoogle Public Data Explorer contains information about dozens of databases related to governance and the economy. You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nILOSTAT is the statistical database of the International Labour Organisation. It has data pertaining to labor, working conditions, industrial relations, poverty and inequality.\nKaggle has data on just about anything you can think of. Very usable, clean data. Just stick to the social science stuff for your project. You can easily download CSV files from Kaggle but you can also access the data through the Kaggle API.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\npeacesciencer is an R package maintained by Steve Miller that compiles data from a number of sources that are useful for peace and conflict studies analysis\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nThe unvotes package provides data on United Nations General Assembly voting patterns.\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century. You can access vdem data through the vdemdata package.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources. You can access WB Development Indicators through the WDI package or the wbstats package.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment. You can access world bank data through the wbstats package.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

See this 3ie working paper for discussion of some common features of CDD.\nGiven these design features, proponents of CDD argue that these programs should (a) improve the quality and impact of development projects (e.g., public goods) AND (b) improve social cohesion, inclusion, and local governance. For this reason, CDD has been implemented in a number of post-conflict settings, where the hope is that CDD can both improve development outcomes and contribute to rebuilding social cohesion and governance (which are often harmed by conflict).\nDoes CDD improve development outcomes?

    "section": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone",
    "text": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone\nSierra Leone was devastated by a civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002. In the post-conflict context, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development implemented the GoBifo (“forge ahead”) CDD project in Sierra Leone from 2005-2009 (with support from the World Bank and other international donors). See this report for a detailed summary of the program.\nThe program had two key components:\n\nBlock grants of about 4,667 dollars (about 100 per household in each community) that communities could allocate to local development projects, skills trainings, and small-business investment.\n“Technical assistance that promoted democratic decision-making, the participation of socially marginalized women and youth in local politics, and transparent budgeting practices” (Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel 2012)\n\nThe GiBifo program also included an impact evaluation, conducted by economists Katherine Casey, Rachel Glennerster, and Edward Miguel. The academic paper generated from the project is in the References section (Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel 2012).\nWait until after you complete your assignment to read the full paper.\nImportantly, the impact evaluation included randomization: communities in the study were randomly assigned to receive the GoBifo program, or not. In this sense, the impact evaluation was similar to a clinical drug trial, where some subjects are randomly assigned to receive the medicine while others do not receive it. This aspect of the design makes it easier to assess the causal impact of this project: we can compare outcomes in the treatment (GoBifo program) and control groups, and test for whether any differences we observe are likely to be due to chance.",

The study team gathered literally hundreds of outcome variables, and the paper includes an interesting discussion of how they analyze the data and interpret the results given the large number of outcomes they measured.\nThe unit of analysis (or row in the dataset) is the village.\nFor our purposes, we will focus on a smaller set of variables, summarized below:\n\nTreatment variable (named t in the data): this equals treatment if the community was randomly assigned to be in the program, and control if not. As a character variable, tidymodels will automatically recognize it as a factor. But be sure to use quotation marks when working with the two categories, e.g. filter(t == \"treatment\").\nCommunity Decision Making Infrastructure: Is there a village development committee in the community? (vdc)\nPublic Goods: Is there a functioning primary school in the community? (f_psch)\nInclusion, Gender equality in participatory decision making (role_wmn).\n\n“Enumerator account of how actively women participated in the deliberation compared to men, ranging from 5 = no difference between women and men to 1 = women not active at all compared to men”\n\nSocial Capital: Trust in other in the community (trust_own)\nConflict: Percentage of respondents in the village that reported they had NO conflicts/disputes with others that required outside intervention (no_conflict)",

    "text": "For this assignment, you are going to evaluate modernization theory as laid out in Seymour Martin Lipset’s classic article entitled “Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy.” How classic is this article? According to Google Scholar, this piece has been cited more than 11.5 thousand times!\nWe are going to use data from V-Dem and modern data viz tools to explore Lipset’s hypothesis that economic modernization is highly correlated with democracy. We have already done this to some extent by looking at the relationship between wealth and the polyarchy score. But we are going to broaden things out by looking at other measures of modernization and democracy contained in the V-Dem dataset.\nBefore starting on this assignment, you will want to have a look at the V-Dem codebook. Look through the sections titled “V-Dem Democracy Indices” (section 2 of the codebook) and “Background Factors (E).” There are five democracy indicators, one of which is the polyarchy index.

    "text": "For this assignment, you are going to evaluate modernization theory as laid out in Seymour Martin Lipset’s classic article entitled “Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy.” How classic is this article? According to Google Scholar, this piece has been cited more than 11.5 thousand times!\nWe are going to use data from V-Dem and modern data viz tools to explore Lipset’s hypothesis that economic modernization is highly correlated with democracy. We have already done this to some extent by looking at the relationship between wealth and the polyarchy score. But we are going to broaden things out by looking at other measures of modernization and democracy contained in the V-Dem dataset.\nBefore starting on this assignment, you will want to have a look at the V-Dem codebook. Look through the sections titled “V-Dem Democracy Indices” (section 2 of the codebook) and “Background Factors (E).” There are five democracy indicators, one of which is the polyarchy index. There are a number of background factors, many of which pertain to economic modernization. We are going to be looking at the relationship between these two sets of variables. In the code book, you will also find a list of country names and codes, which will be useful for downloading and filtering the data.\nNow have a look at “Some Social Requisites of Democracy” and in particular pay attention to the indicators in Table II and the discussion surrounding them.

    "text": "Emergency Preparedness and Response Procedures\nThe University has asked all faculty to inform students of these procedures, prepared by the GW Office of Public Safety and Emergency Management in collaboration with the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.\n\nTo Report an Emergency or Suspicious Activity\nCall the University Police Department at 202-994-6111 (Foggy Bottom) or 202-242-6111 (Mount Vernon).\n\n\nShelter in Place – General Guidance\nAlthough it is unlikely that we will ever need to shelter in place, it is helpful to know what to do just in case. No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter in place will generally remain the same.\n\nIf you are inside, stay where you are unless the building you are in is affected. If it is affected, you should evacuate. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the scene.\nLocate an interior room to shelter inside. If possible, it should be above ground level and have the fewest number of windows. If sheltering in a room with windows, move away from the windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms may be necessary.\nShut and lock all windows (for a tighter seal) and close exterior doors.\nTurn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off ventilation systems as quickly as possible).\nMake a list of the people with you and ask someone to call the list in to UPD so they know where you are sheltering and who is with you. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list.\nAwait further instructions. If possible, visit GW Campus Advisories for incident updates or call the GW Information Line 202-994-5050.\nMake yourself comfortable and look after one other. You will get word as soon as it is safe to come out.\n\n\n\nEvacuation\nAn evacuation will be considered if the building we are in is affected or we must move to a location of greater safety. We will always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds. In the event of an evacuation, please gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, GWorld card, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit. Every classroom has a map at the door designating both the shortest egress and an alternate egress. Anyone who is physically unable to walk down the stairs should wait in the stairwell, behind the closed doors. Firemen will check the stairwells upon entering the building. Once you have evacuated the building, proceed to our primary rendezvous location: the court yard area between the GW Hospital and Ross Hall. In the event that this location is unavailable, we will meet on the ground level of the Visitors Parking Garage (I Street entrance, at 22nd Street). From our rendezvous location, we will await instructions to re-enter the School.\n\n\nAlert DC\nAlert DC provides free notification by e-mail or text message during an emergency. Visit GW Campus Advisories for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to GW. If you receive an Alert DC notification during class, you are encouraged to share the information immediately.\n\n\nGW Alert\nGW Alert provides popup notification to desktop and laptop computers during an emergency. In the event that we receive an alert to the computer in our classroom, we will follow the instructions given. You are also encouraged to download this application to your personal computer. Visit GW Campus Advisories to learn how.\n\n\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information about emergency preparedness and response at GW or the University’s operating status can be found on GW Campus Advisories or by calling the GW Information Line at 202-994-5050.",

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nFirst, let’s grab the relevant data using vdemdata and dplyr. We are going to be downloading the polyarchy measure for the U.S., Japan and Portugal as far back as the data are available. So first we will select country name, year and the polyarchy schore and then we will filter the data based on the three country names. We are saving these data in an object called dem_waves_ctrs.\n\nlibrary(vdemdata)\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- vdem |&gt;\n  select(\n    country = country_name,     \n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n  ) |&gt;\n  filter( \n    country %in% c(\"United States of America\", # select countries in this list\n                   \"Japan\", \n                   \"Portugal\")\n    )\n\nwrite_csv(dem_waves_ctrs, \"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. The data will be the dem_waves_ctrs object that we just created. You can should have the data saved but you can also download it here. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to `1’ so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Country” with a capital “C.”\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )",

    "text": "Scatter plots\n\nThe last thing we are going to do in this lesson is to create a scatter plot. We use scatter plots in order to illustrate how two variables relate to each other (or not). In this example, we are going to illustrating modernization theory, which predicts a positive relationship between wealth and democracy, while also incorporating levels of women’s representation into our analysis.\nWe are going to start with the dem_women.csv file that you can find here. We will then group the data by country and calculate the mean for each variable. Note that in the group_by() call we also include region because we will want to keep it so that we can color our points by region.\n\ndem_summary_ctry &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_women.csv\") |&gt;\n  group_by(country, region) |&gt; # group by country, keep region\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), \n    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), \n    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow let’s create our first scatter plot. Our ggplot() call looks similar to previous ones except for a few things. First we are calling geom_point() for our geom. But also notice that our aesthetics mapping includes four dimenstions: x, y, color and size. So here we are telling ggplot2 that we want wealth on the x-axis, the polyarchy score on the y-axis, to color the points based on region, and to vary the size of the points in relation to the level of women’s representation.\nOne last thing we want to do is to put our x-axis on a log scale and change the labels to reflect their dollar values. For the log scale, we can use the scale_x_log10() function and for the labels we can use the label_number() function from the scales package. We set the prefix to “$” and the suffix to “k” so that each number on the x-axis starts with a dollar sign and ends with “k” denoting “thousands.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will encounter other useful scales functions including label_dollar() and label_percent() in future lessons.\nNotice that in this example we introduce the scales package by including it as a prefix to the label_number() function, e.g. scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\"). This allows us to use the package without having to load it, e.g. library(scales). It also has the benefit of generating a list of auto-complete suggestions for the many available functions in the scales package.\n\n\n\n# in this ggplot() call we have four dimensions\n# x, y, color, and size\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy, color = region, size = women_rep)) + \n  geom_point() + # use geom_point() for scatter plots\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\",\n    size = \"Women Reps\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot does a good job of illustrating the basic point of modernization theory in that we do see the positive correlation between wealth and democracy. But we also see that there are some outliers and that a lot of the outlier countries are concentrated in the Middle East.\nWe also see that the distribution of women’s representation is somewhat orthogonal to wealth and democracy. Most wealthy western countries have high levels of women’s representation, but so do a lot of low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nAdding a trend line\nWe can definitely see a relationship between wealth and democracy in the scatter plot, but how strong is it? One way to find out is to add a trend line. Let’s do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth(), and specifying a linear model with the argument method = \"lm\" We acn also set the linewidth of the trend line to 1 so that the line is more visible.\nIf we want to add a single trend while also maintaining the coloring by region, then we have to reconfigure the ggplot() call a bit. Specifically, we will want to move color = region to a separate aes() call in the geom_point() function, e.g. geom_point(aes(color = region)). If we don’t do this we will get separate trend lines for each region (try it and see!).\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\nLabeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )",

    "text": "Downloading data from the V-Dem API\n\nThe first thing we want to talk about is how to filter observations and to select variables for analysis. We will also delve into the topic of how to create new variables. To illustrate these concepts, we are going to be working with the V-Dem Dataset. The V-Dem offers an R package for downloading its data called vdemdata.\nvdemdata is perfect for illustrating the filter() and select() verbs because its main function for downloading the data (vdem) does not take any arguments (it simply downloads the whole dataset). So you have to use R functions to narrow down the variables and years you want to work with.\nWhile V-Dem has wealth of indicators related to democracy, we are going to focus on the most famous one called the “polyarchy” score. We are also going to download data on per capita GDP and create some indicator variables for region that we will use later on when we summarize the data. Along with those variables, we also want to retain country_name, year and country_id for the purposes of merging these data with our World Bank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile V-Dem has a variable look-up tool (find_var), it does not provide very much information on the variables that the search function returns. Therefore, if you want to use this package for your own research, I highly recommend just going to the V-Dem codebook and manually grabbing the codes for the indicators that you want to use in your analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to filtering out years and selecting variables, let’s also create a region coding to facilitate our analysis later on. We will do this by piping in a mutate() call where we use the case_match() function to change the region from a numeric variable to a string. This will come in handy when we go to visualize the data in future lessons.\nWe will store our new data as an object called democracy.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data\n\n# Download the data\ndemocracy &lt;- vdem |&gt; # download the V-Dem dataset\n  filter(year &gt;= 1990)  |&gt; # filter out years less than 1990\n  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables\n    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  \n    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name\n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, \n    region = e_regionpol_6C\n    ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with names\n                     1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                     2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                     3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                     4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                     5 ~ \"The West\", \n                     6 ~ \"Asia\")\n                    # number on the left of the ~ is the V-Dem region code\n                    # we are changing the number to the country name on the right\n                    # of the equals sign\n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 6,204\nColumns: 6\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.389, 0.412, 0.437, 0.447, 0.470, 0.480, 0.508, 0.556, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 24.396, 25.077, 25.561, 25.967, 26.101, 25.434, 25.851, 2…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…",
